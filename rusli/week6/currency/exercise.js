// Find the exchange rate between dollars and pounds
// Store the exchange rate in a variable
// Converting dollars to pounds:

// Store a dollar amount into a variable.
// Convert it to pounds and output "$NN is £NN".
// Converting pounds to dollars:

// Now store a pound amount into a variable.
// Convert it to dollar and output "£NN is $NN."
// Cleaning it up:

// Can you make sure the output is only 2 decimal places?
// Refactoring

// Can you refactor the code so that it uses functions? Write a function dollarsToPounds that takes a dollar number as input and outputs a string of what the pound equivalent is.
// Do the same for poundsToDollars

var currentRateAUBP = 0.5457 // AUD_TO_GBP

var a = currentRate * 10

var currentRateBPAU = 1.8326

var b = currentRateBPAU
